# Startup-Success-Rate-Prediction-using-Machine-learning-Including-FeatureSelection-Accuracy-86Percent
The "Startup Success Prediction"  project involves data collection, data analysis, feature selection, and machine learning modeling to predict the success or failure of new startups. The project can provide valuable insights and guidance for investors and entrepreneurs looking to make informed decisions about the potential success of new startups.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This Project consists of the Exploratory Data Analysis, Prediction of Startup Success Rate and implementing Feature selection for improving the accuracy.
Various Machine Learning Algorithms like Random Forest, Decision Tree , SVM and Gradient Boost algorithms have been implemented along with Feature Selection for achieving best possible Accuracy. Feature Selection techniques like Chi Square test and inbuilt feature selection tools of scikit library has been used for enhancing the accuracy.
